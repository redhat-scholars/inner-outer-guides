# Vote App Lab Development - Argo CD

The next step is to deploy the Vote App to the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` environment using Argo CD. This will allow us to view the application before it reaches production and make necessary changes throughout our development flow. We'll also use the OpenShift Web Terminal to scale up the replicas for one of the deployments and learn how to use Argo CD to manage application drifts and syncing.

## Creating a new application using Argo CD

Let's use Argo CD to create a new application. While you can access Argo CD from the *Lab Guides* or by using this link:https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Argo CD link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. You can also visit Argo CD from your OpenShift cluster. Within the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the `argocd-%USERID%` project, and visit the *Topology* page.

Click on the *Argo CD* route to visit the Argo CD dashboard. You'll be prompted to log in to Argo CD, and you can use the *Login with OpenShift* button to do so.

Within the Argo CD web console, click the *+ New App* button. This will open the *New Application* form, where we can fill in the necessary information to create a new application in our development environment.

Fill in the following information, many of which may auto-fill when selected:

* Application Name: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`
* Project Name: `default`
* Sync Policy: `Automatic`
* Self Heal: `Disabled`
* Auto-Create Namespace: `Enabled`
* Repository URL: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
http://gitea.gitea.svc:3000/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops
----

* Revision: `main`
* Path: `environments/dev`
* Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* Namespace: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`

When finished, click the *CREATE* button in the top left-hand corner. This will create the application in Argo CD and begin the syncing process.

## Viewing the application in Argo CD

Now, let's view the application in the Argo CD dashboard. After creating the application, you should be redirected to the application details page. If not, click on the application's name to view the application details.

Here, you'll see the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application's health, sync status, and associated resources. Your application may sync very quickly, with a green `Synced` status, however, you may see a yellow `OutOfSync` status.

We can see the associated resources within the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application, including the `vote-ui` deployment, `vote-api` deployment, and `vote-ui` route. We can also see the services associated with each deployment.

## Viewing the application in the OpenShift web console


You might be wondering what creating your Application in Argo CD achieved. From the OpenShift web console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the *Topology* tab. Here, we can view the *vote-app* application group and view the `vote-ui` deployment in our browser by link:https://vote-ui-vote-app-dev-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*clicking the route*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

This will open the application in a new tab, and we can view the deployed application!

Great! We're able to see the newly deployed Vote App in our browser through this development environment.

## Using the Web Terminal to modify the development project

Now, let's use the OpenShift Web Terminal to modify a deployment and demonstrate that we still need to establish self-healing or high availability. From the OpenShift Web Console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the *Terminal* icon from the top right of the page.

image::terminal-icon.png[Web Terminal Icon]

This is the OpenShift Web Terminal, which allows us a terminal in a pod from the OpenShift Web Console and run commands directly within the cluster. Let's run the following command to scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc scale deployment vote-ui --replicas=2
----

image::scale-up.png[Scale Up]

This command will scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas. Now, we can return to the Argo CD `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application to see how the application has automatically been determined to be out of sync.

image::argocd-app-details-3.png[Argo CD App Details]

As this is our development project, we specified Argo CD to not manually adjust our application when drift is detected, however, in our production environment, we'll enable this for high availability. For now, click *Sync* and select *Synchronize* to sync the application back to the manifests in the link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops[Vote App GitOps,role='params-link',window='_blank'] repository.

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed the Vote App to the development environment using Argo CD, we can use OpenShift DevSpaces to develop and test the application locally before moving to the production module and deploying the application in the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` project.
