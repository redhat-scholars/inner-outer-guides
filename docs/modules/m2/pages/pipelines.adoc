# Vote App Lab Development - Pipelines

In this section, you will learn how to use a Tekton pipeline resource and trigger the Pipeline to run. The Pipeline will first clone the git repository source code of the `vote-api` and `vote-ui` repositories. The Pipeline will then build the application and push the image to the internal image registry. We'll also later add a webhook to the `vote-ui` to trigger when a commit is made to the Git repository. Finally, the Pipeline will update the deployment in the `vote-app-gitops` repository with the new image.

## Viewing the pipelines

Let's use the OpenShift Console to view the pipelines created for you. Within the *Developer* perspective of the OpenShift Console, click on the *Pipelines* link in the left navigation menu. You can also use link:https://console-openshift-console.apps.%SUBDOMAIN%/dev-pipelines/all-namespaces[*this link*,role='params-link',window='_blank'] to head to the Pipelines page directly.

Here, we will select the `vote-app-ci-%USERID%` project, where the pipelines have been created. This section details all the pipelines we'll be using in the workshop, details about the last pipeline run, the status of the tasks, and more relevant details about the Pipeline. You should see three pipelines, `promote-to-prod`, `vote-app-api-pipeline`, and `vote-app-ui-pipeline`.

image::pipelines-default.png[]

Before we start the pipelines, let's look at one of the pipeline contents. Click on the `vote-app-api-pipeline` pipeline to view the pipeline details. Select *YAML* to view the pipeline definition in link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml[*YAML format*,window='_blank']. You should see the pipeline definition, along with the tasks that are defined in the Pipeline.

image::pipeline-yaml.png[]

This Pipeline YAML defines the tasks to be run in the Pipeline and also defines the parameters used in the Pipeline, such as the git repository URL, the image name, and more. 

image::pipeline-yaml-content.png[]

We can also view the pipeline content below. The last YAML definition is a task that helps to bundle multiple actions together, including cloning the git repository, updating image digests, and committing changes.

## Starting the `vote-app-api` pipeline

Let's start these pipelines by using a link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelineruns/[PipelineRun,window='_blank'], which is a custom resource that allows you to start a pipeline. This PipelineRun will start the `vote-app-api-pipeline` pipeline, which will build the `vote-api` image, and push it to the local registry. From the *Pipelines* view, select the `vote-app-api-pipeline` pipeline.

image::pipeline-list.png[]

Here, you can review the pipeline steps and see what each step is doing. You can also see the pipeline resources that are being used.

image::pipeline-details.png[]

For reference, here are the pipeline steps:

- `git-clone`: This step clones the local Git repository that contains the source code for the application. We're able to do so because of a `gitea-gitops` secret that was created for you. This secret contains the username and password to access the Gitea repository.
- `build-and-push`: This step builds the image and pushes it to the internal OpenShift registry. The image name is passed in as a parameter.
- `git-update-deployment`: This final step updates the deployment manifests in the Git repository.

Now, let's start the Pipeline. Click on the top-right *Actions* then *Start* button to start the Pipeline.

image::pipeline-start-button.png[]

You will be prompted to enter the values for the pipeline parameters, however the default values are already set for you. This includes the source Git repository, image name to build, and GitOps manifest repository.

image::pipeline-start-params.png[]

You'll still need to select a workspace, so scroll to the bottom of the form, select *Persistent Volume Claim*, and choose the `workspace-app-api-source` PVC. This link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Persistent Volume Claim (PVC),window='_blank'] workspace gives us persistent storage that the Pipeline can access even in a containerized environment. Now, click on the *Start* button.

image::pipeline-start.png[]

Now that the `vote-app-api` pipeline has been started, we can view it in action from the *PipelineRuns* view. We'll need to wait for this first PipelineRun to finish before we can start the `vote-app-ui-pipeline` pipeline, which should take about 1-2 minutes.

image::pipelinerun-list-api.png[]

## Starting the `vote-app-ui` pipeline

With the `vote-app-api-pipeline` PipelineRun completed, we can now start the `vote-app-ui-pipeline` pipeline. Let's repeat the same steps for this other Pipeline, first selecting it from the *Pipelines* view.

image::pipeline-ui-list-dashboard.png[]

Here, we can go ahead and start the Pipeline. The tasks are essentially the same as the `vote-app-api`, so we can click the top-right *Actions* then *Start* button to start the Pipeline.

image::pipeline-ui-start.png[]

You'll notice that the only change here is the difference in the source Git repository and image name to build.

image::pipeline-ui-start-params.png[]

Although the default values are already set for you, you'll still need to select a workspace, so select *Persistent Volume Claim* and choose the `workspace-ui-app-source` PVC. Now, click on the *Start* button.

image::pipeline-ui-start-2.png[]

Now that the `vote-app-ui` pipeline has been started, let's go ahead and check the status of this Pipeline. We should be at the *PipelineRuns* view, and after a minute or two, the `vote-app-ui-pipeline` PipelineRun should be completed.

image::pipelinerun-finish-ui.png[]

## Checking the status of the pipelines

From the *PipelineRuns* section, we can examine various details about the specific PipelineRun, such as the YAML executed, each TaskRun executed, parameters used for the PipelineRun, and logs from each Task.

image::pipelinerun-status.png[]

For example, viewing the logs from the `build-and-push` Task, we can see the output from the _build_ and _push_ actions, which use the link:https://buildah.io/[Buildah,window='_blank'] `bud` command.

image::pipelinerun-logs.png[]

## Checking the status of the applications

Now that the pipelines have been started let's check the status of the deployments. Click on the *Topology* left-hand tab to see the list of deployments that have been created. We now have a new application called *Triggers* which contains two deployments, one for the `vote-api` and one for the `vote-ui`.

image::deployment-status.png[]

You can click on a deployment to see the details of the deployment, including the pods that are running, which is an event listener, allowing us to trigger a new build of the application when a change is made to the Git repository.

image::deployment-details-el.png[]

## Start `vote-ui` with a Webhook

Tekton supports link:https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/[Triggers,window='_blank'] to enable automation and webhooks. Now that the `vote-ui` deployment is running, let's add a webhook to the Gitea repository to trigger a new build of the application when changes are made to the repository. From the *Topology* view, click on the `el-eventlistener-ui` deployment. From there, navigate to the *Routes* section and copy the `el-eventlistener-ui` Route URL from the bottom right-hand corner.

image::trigger-vote-ui.png[Trigger Vote UI]

Once you have the URL copied to your clipboard, navigate to the `pipelines-vote-ui` code repository that you have on link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/pipelines-vote-ui[*Gitea*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. From your repository page, click on the Settings menu in the top-right corner. From the top right-side menu, click on *Settings*, then *Webhooks*. Then, click on *Add Webhook* from the right-side menu.

image::add-webhook.png[Add Webhook]

Paste the copied Route URL into the *Target URL* field in the next screen. You can leave the other fields blank; just ensure the Content Type is set to `application/json`. Finally, click on *Add Webhook* to create the webhook.

image::create-webhook.png[Create Webhook]

Great, now we have a webhook that will trigger a new build of the application when changes are made to the Git repository. Later on in this module, we'll make some changes to the source code using OpenShift Dev Spaces and push the changes to the Git repository to trigger a new build.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed the `vote-app` and `vote-api` pipelines using Tekton Pipelines. You've also added a webhook to the `vote-ui` pipeline to trigger a new build when changes are made to the Git repository. Now, let's move on to the next lab to learn how to deploy the application using Argo CD.
